# Gold - The programming language

Hello, first at all this language is made for fun and research purpose, you can use it if you want.

Gold is heavily inspired by Monkey from the books of Thorsten Ball. The first version of Gold will
follow its guideline in "Writing An Interpreter In Go" and "Writing A Compiler In Go" plus some
addition of myself. I will list my modification in change logs, thus after completed these books
I will modify this language to my please, which also will be noted in the changes logs.
